#imdb_dataset.py
"""
Local IMDb ratings source, sourced from IMDb's own non-commercial datasets
(https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.ratings.tsv.gz) rather than MDBList.

Why this exists: every rating PostersPlus can weight — including the one
labelled "imdb" — currently comes from a single MDBList API call per title.
That is fine for the many sources MDBList aggregates (Letterboxd, Trakt,
Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, ...), which have no public bulk-download route.
IMDb is the one exception: IMDb itself publishes a free, no-key-required,
daily-refreshed TSV of every title's aggregate rating and vote count. An
operator who only cares about the IMDb score does not need an MDBList key
(or its rate limits) at all to get one.

This module downloads that TSV on a schedule, loads it into a small SQLite
table keyed on the IMDb id (tconst), and answers point lookups from it. It
never makes a per-title network call — the whole dataset is pulled in one
shot on a timer, matching the pattern digital_release.py uses for its own
periodic background sync.

Enabled with IMDB_DATASET_ENABLED=true. Fully inert (no download, no table,
lookups always return None) when disabled — the default.
